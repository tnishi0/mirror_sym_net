**Usage**: net = mirror_sym_net(nA,nB,nBp,p)

**Output**: struct variable 'net' with fields, 'nA', 'nB', 'nBp', 'p', 'A'

If no input argument is given, it will use:

  nA = 6, nB = 30, nBp = 2, p = 0.8

The indexing for the adjacency matrix 'net.A' is as follows:

  Group A: i = 1, ... ,nA  
  Group B: i = nA+1, ..., nA+nB  
  Group C: i = nA+nB+1, ..., N (= 2*nA + nB)

As an example of a network generated by this algorithm, the adjacency matrix of Fig. 2(a) of the paper referenced above is provided in the file adj_mat.txt.
